    "EM: As we continue the course, we'll move into topics that deal with the use of Python tools for data science applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "JV: What is *data science*?\n",
    "It's a surprisingly hard definition to nail down, especially given how ubiquitous the term has become.\n",
    "Vocal critics have variously dismissed the term as a superfluous label (after all, what science doesn't involve data?) or a simple buzzword that only exists to salt resumes and catch the eye of overzealous tech recruiters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my mind, these critiques miss something important.\n",
    "Data science, despite its hype-laden veneer, is perhaps the best label we have for the cross-disciplinary set of skills that are becoming increasingly important in many applications across industry and academia.\n",
    "This cross-disciplinary piece is key: in my mind, the best extisting definition of data science is illustrated by Drew Conway's Data Science Venn Diagram, first published on his blog in September 2010:"

    "While some of the intersection labels are a bit tongue-in-cheek, this diagram captures the essence of what I think people mean when they say \"data science\": it is fundamentally an *interdisciplinary* subject.\n",
    "Data science comprises three distinct and overlapping areas: the skills of a *statistician* who knows how to model and summarize datasets (which are growing ever larger); the skills of a *computer scientist* who can design and use algorithms to efficiently store, process, and visualize this data; and the *domain expertise*—what we might think of as \"classical\" training in a subject—necessary both to formulate the right questions and to put their answers in context.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, I would encourage you to think of data science not as a new domain of knowledge to learn, but a new set of skills that you can apply within your current area of expertise.\n",
    "Whether you are reporting election results, forecasting stock returns, optimizing online ad clicks, identifying microorganisms in microscope photos, seeking new classes of astronomical objects, or working with data in any other field, the goal of the following chapters is to give you the ability to ask and answer new questions about your chosen subject area."

    "## Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has emerged over the last couple decades as a first-class tool for scientific computing tasks, including the analysis and visualization of large datasets.\n",
    "This may have come as a surprise to early proponents of the Python language: the language itself was not specifically designed with data analysis or scientific computing in mind.\n",
    "The usefulness of Python for data science stems primarily from the large and active ecosystem of third-party packages: *NumPy* for manipulation of homogeneous array-based data, *Pandas* for manipulation of heterogeneous and labeled data, *SciPy* for common scientific computing tasks, *Matplotlib* for publication-quality visualizations, *IPython* for interactive execution and sharing of code, *Scikit-Learn* for machine learning, and many more tools that will be mentioned in the following pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin in the following chapter with NumPy, which provides an efficient way to store and manipulate multi-dimensional dense arrays in Python."
